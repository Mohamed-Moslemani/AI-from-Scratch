## Project Overview

AI from Scratch provides a collection of machine learning and AI algorithms implemented from the ground up. The primary goal is to explore and understand the basic principles that power machine learning models, gaining insight into each component of the algorithm, including data processing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- Pure Python implementations
- Educational documentation for each algorithm
- Clear, modular code structure
- Examples and usage instructions included

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohamed-moslemani/AI-from-Scratch.git
   cd AI-from-Scratch
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Although external libraries are minimized, a few libraries may be required (e.g., NumPy). You can install these via:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Each algorithm is contained within its own directory, with example scripts to run and test it. To run an algorithm, navigate to its directory and execute the script:

```bash
cd [algorithm_name]
python main.py
```

For instance, to run the K-Nearest Neighbors implementation:
```bash
cd KNN
python main.py
```

## Implemented Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Neural Networks**
- **K-Means Clustering**

Each algorithm includes:

- Code with comments for better understanding
- Example datasets and usage instructions
- Results and accuracy metrics
