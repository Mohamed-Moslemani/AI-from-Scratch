## 📖 Project Overview

**AI from Scratch** provides a hands-on experience to understand the basic principles that power machine learning models, from data processing and model training to evaluation. Each algorithm is built from the ground up to illustrate the core mechanics of AI. 📊

## ✨ Features

- 📝 Pure Python implementations
- 📚 Educational documentation for each algorithm
- 📁 Clear, modular code structure
- 🧪 Example datasets and usage instructions

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohamed-moslemani/AI-from-Scratch.git
   cd AI-from-Scratch
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Although external libraries are minimized, a few libraries may be required (e.g., NumPy). You can install these via:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ Usage

Each algorithm is contained within its own directory, with example scripts to run and test it. To run an algorithm, navigate to its directory and execute the script:

```bash
cd [algorithm_name]
python main.py
```

For instance, to run the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) implementation:
```bash
cd KNN
python main.py
```
